Member 4: Deployment & Saving Model using Pickle
Role Overview
Member 4 is responsible for deploying the trained model and ensuring that it can be reused without retraining. This involves:

Saving the trained model using Pickle for later use.

Ensuring the model can be loaded and used for new predictions.

Preparing the model for integration into a real-world application.

Background of the Tasks
Why Do We Save the Model?

Training a model takes time and computational resources. Instead of retraining every time, we save it for reuse.

Pickle allows the model to be stored as a file and later loaded without losing its learned parameters.

It helps in deploymentâ€”where the model is used in a real-world setting (e.g., an API, website, or software).

What is Pickle?

Pickle is a Python library used to serialize (convert into a file format) and deserialize (load from a file) Python objects.

It ensures that our trained model can be saved and retrieved efficiently.

Steps Involved in Model Deployment
1. Saving the Model
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it needs to be saved for future use.

Implementation in Code:

python
Copy
Edit
import pickle
pickle.dump(model, open("model.pkl", 'wb'))
pickle.dump() writes the trained Logistic Regression model to a file named "model.pkl".

The 'wb' mode means write binary, ensuring the model is stored efficiently.

2. Loading the Model for Future Use
To use the model without retraining, we load it from the saved file.

Implementation in Code:

python
Copy
Edit
model = pickle.load(open("model.pkl", 'rb'))
pickle.load() reads the stored model from "model.pkl".

The 'rb' mode means read binary, restoring the model with all its trained parameters.

3. Using the Loaded Model for Predictions
Once loaded, the model can predict on new data just like before.

Implementation in Code:

python
Copy
Edit
new_predictions = model.predict(new_data)
model.predict() takes new input data and outputs predictions.

This can be integrated into a web application, mobile app, or an API to detect network anomalies dynamically.

Challenges Faced
Model Compatibility: If the environment changes (e.g., different Python versions), the Pickle file may not load properly.

Security Risks: Pickle files can be manipulated, so they should only be loaded from trusted sources.

File Storage & Management: Ensuring the model is stored in a secure and accessible location for deployment.

Conclusion
The model was successfully saved and loaded using Pickle.

It can now be deployed in a real-world system without retraining.

This step ensures scalability and efficiency, making the project practical for use in network anomaly detection systems.
